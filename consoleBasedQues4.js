// Explaination

// In the given code, a self-invoking function is defined, which creates a local scope. Inside the function, two variables x and y are declared using the var keyword.

// The code then enters a try-catch block where a new Error object is thrown. The catch block takes an argument x, which shadows the outer variable x. Inside the catch block, x is assigned a value of 1 and y is assigned a value of 2. The value of the caught x is then logged to the console, which will output 1.

// After the catch block, the code continues outside the catch block and logs the value of x. However, this refers to the outer x variable because the x variable inside the catch block is scoped to the catch block itself. Since the outer x variable was not assigned a value, it will be undefined. Therefore, the second console.log(x) will output undefined.

// Finally, the value of y is logged to the console, which is 2 because it was assigned a value inside the catch block. So the last console.log(y) will output 2.
